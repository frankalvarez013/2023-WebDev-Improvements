Should plan:
    Mobile phone
        Only so much you can work On
            Work on smaller to bigger because its easier
    
Dont use units for line height - it removes the ratio?

width - relative to container

max-width - relative to the image itself

Body
    If you apply something that has to do with text
    the children will inherit
    If you apply something that has to do with sizing, 
    it will only affect the Body(not inherit)

if we use (element) > * {} that style
the (parent > *) says give this styles to all the children within this parents
alone. Don't style the children of the children

border-box:
