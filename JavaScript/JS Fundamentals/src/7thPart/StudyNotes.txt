Intermediate HTML & CSS
    Planning
        1. UX - Identifying problems, researching solutions
        2. UI - Informed by UX, create an interface to address the problem. Test early and often
        3. Content - Informed by UX, tell a story about the problem and its solution
        4. HTML - Identify the parts of the content: list, links, heading, etc.
        5. CSS - Make the marked up content look pretty. Add HTML sparginly only to hold required CSS classes and group elements for styling

    HTML Elements Vocab
        Indentifies the elements of the web page
            NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISPLAY OF THE PAGE
    
    Cascade
        Whath happens when you declare/intiate two tags on CSS? like on seperate places one at the start of the doc, or end of the doc.
        Cascade means that the later initalization of the tag will win.

    Pseudo-Classes
        Example
            These are the unvisited links of a page
            a:link{
            }

            These are the visited links of a page
            a:visited{
            }
        
            a.harvard{} (any a tag that has a class of harvard)
            a.harvard:link{} any a tag that has a class of harvard with an unvisisted link
        
            ul a:link {} for all unvisited links located inside of an unordered list (child)
    
    Grouped Selectors
        h2, h4 {
            color: red;
        }
    
    ID
        Used once in HTML, used mainly for JS
        Example:
            #myID {
                color: blue;
            }

CSS Spacing
    The Box Model
        Box Model contains padding, border, margin, width and height
        It also has an display:inline, display:block
    Padding
        A good way of diagnosing your CSS is putting a border around your HTMLElements

    Block vs Inline 
        Block - Covers the whole container
        Inline - Covers only the content
    
    CSS Units
        EM - em depends ->
            Example
                lower case m is lower than capital M
                padding: 1 rem to a h1 and p will be different
        REM
            Example
                Same size
