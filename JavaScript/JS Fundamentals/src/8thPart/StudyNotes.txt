INTRODUCTION
    HTML is used to convey information
    Meaning and organization are the core concepts of HTML

TEXT

    Practice:
        Span is for Paragraphs no need to break it up into blocks
        HTML is not a decorative flavor, its a meaning and a story

    Variables & Styling SetUp:
        :root <- pseudo class - indicates top of the document
            Why not use html css property? cuz we want to load this before the 
            pseudo class is more heavily weighted in the cascade than in HTML
            :root are global, the variables inside such as:
            --black: #412311;
            Will actually be variables we can use that are prewritten for us.
