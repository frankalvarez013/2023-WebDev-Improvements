INTRODUCTION
    HTML is used to convey information
    Meaning and organization are the core concepts of HTML

TEXT

    Practice:
        Span is for Paragraphs no need to break it up into blocks
        HTML is not a decorative flavor, its a meaning and a story

    Variables & Styling SetUp:
        :root <- pseudo class - indicates top of the document
            Why not use html css property? cuz we want to load this before the 
            pseudo class is more heavily weighted in the cascade than in HTML
            :root are global, the variables inside such as:
            --black: #412311;
            Will actually be variables we can use that are prewritten for us.

CSS OVERVIEW

    CSS Reset Box-sizing
        Anything that comes before it and after it apply this onto everything
        *,  
        *::before,
        *::after{
            box-sizing: border-box; //default is the content-box - when we start to figure out how big everything is, we are going to add the width of border, pading, and margin + copntent will be
            the width of our box.
            when we include border-box we include all of that. 
            So when we say border box we will lump it all so if we say width is 500 pixel in content box the content would be 500px - we would still have to add more that the padding the border and the margin
            now border box will contain all of that in the 500px
        }

    Class, ID, & Descendent Selectors
        /* */
        > just gets the immediate children
        ul .nested > li {  (read backwards) li is the child of .nested whose descendent(different from child cuz it goes all the way to the top of the tree) is ul

        }
        ul.nested <- ul with a class of nested together

        ul.nested > li ~ li {
            //will not affect the first sibling
        }

    Attribute Selector
        HTML would look like this <li>Here is an <a href="#" target="_blank" title="unguessable">
        [title="unguessable"] {
            color:white;
        }
        substring...
        [title*="guess"] {
            color:white;
        }
